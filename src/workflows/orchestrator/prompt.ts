You can analyze results from the previous steps already executed to decide if the objective is complete.
Your plan must be structured in sequential steps, with each step containing independent parallel subtasks.

Objective: ${variables.objective}

You have access to the following Agents with their tools:

Agents:
${variables.agents}

Generate a plan with all remaining steps needed.
Steps are sequential, but each Step can have parallel subtasks.
For each Step, specify an objective of the step and independent subtasks that can run in parallel.
For each subtask specify:
    1. Clear description of the task that an LLM can execute  
    2. Name of 1 Agent OR List of MCP server names to use for the task
    
Return your response in the following JSON structure:
    {{
        "steps": [
            {{
                "objective": "Objective for this step 1",

You must respond with valid JSON only, with no triple backticks. No markdown formatting.
No extra text. Do not wrap in \`\`\`json code fences.`;
